#  Deep Learning Micro Projects

1. Customer Churn Model Prediction: Built an Artificial Neural Network model which predicts the customers at the highest risk of leaving the bank. having multiple features of a customer such as Credit score, Gender, Age Factor, Tenure, Account Balance, Number of products, Details regarding having a credit card and being an active member, Estimated Salary etc. We take all the features as input and classify the test data output by providing the customer leaving the bank or not.

2. Neural Network for hand written Digits classification: In the project we design and implement the deep learning model that learns to recognize sequences of digit. We will train the model using synthetic data generated by concatenating character images from MNIST. The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. 

3. Potato Disease Classification: 
   - Credits: codebasics(Dhaval Patel) 
   - The project is related to agriculture domain,  Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants. We will use image classification       using CNN and built a mobile app using which a farmer can take a picture and app will tell you if the plant has a disease or not. Technology stack for this project will be,

      Model Building: tensorflow, CNN, data augmentation, tf dataset
      Backend Server and ML Ops: tf serving, FastAPI
      Model Optimization: Quantization, Tensorflow lite
      Frontend: React JS, React Native
      Deployment: GCP (Google cloud platform, GCF (Google cloud functions)
    - Data: Data is obtained from Kaggle, We provide the input as images of potato plant with Early blight, late blight, and healthy leaves.
