# Wine Classier

The project aimed to check the wine quality(red wine and white wine) with respective physico-chemical properties. The project is inspired and data is used from [ UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality), The data usage permission were created by [P. Cortez](https://http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/). Further, Vinho verde(Wine) is a unique product from the Minho (northwest) region of Portugal. Medium in alcohol, is it particularly appreciated due to its freshness (specially in the summer).
To check the wine quality the physico-chemical properties were, 
* Fixed acidity
* Volatile acidity
* Citric acid
* Residual sugar
* Chlorides
* Free sulfur dioxide
* Total sulfur dioxide
* Density
* pH
* Sulphates
* Alcohol
* Quality (score between 0 and 10)
